# InventoryAPI
A simple RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core (.NET 9) that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on an inventory database. It uses Entity Framework Core for data access, supports Swagger for interactive API documentation, and follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns via Services, Repositories, and DTOs.
